### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Yosbi, a computer scientist who is passionate about open-source philosophy (open-source evangelist) and who has several areas of interest, some of them are: Linux and Android operating systems, A.I. applied to IoT, develop mobile apps (Android and iOS), game engines and graphic programming, game development (and playing games too).

I also enjoy solving challenging algorithms and building things.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently researching and developing brand new products and technologies, working specifically in high-performance algorithms, machine learning, and Bayesian networks for embedded computing (IoT) and mobile apps (mainly native iOS and Android).
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about backend development using Spring Boot to complement the IoT (embedded programming).
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at: Yosbito@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I drink coffee and do stuff...
