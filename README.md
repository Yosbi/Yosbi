### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Yosbi, a computer scientist who is passionate about open-source philosophy (open-source evangelist) and who has several areas of interest, some of them are: Linux and Android operating systems, A.I. applied to IoT, game engines and graphic programming, game development (and playing games too), and also I like to develop mobile (Android and iOS) apps and backends.

I also enjoy solving challenging algorithms and building things.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently researching and developing brand new products and technologies, working specifically in high-performance algorithms, machine learning, bayesian networks, embedded computing (IoT), and mobile development (mainly native iOS and Android) at Johnson Controls.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about backend development using Spring Boot to complement the IoT (embedded programming).
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at: Yosbito@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I drink coffee and do stuff...
